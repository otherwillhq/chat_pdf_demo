# PDF Chatbot

We are building a platform to build generative ai apps @ http://otherwill.com , so you can sign up for beta access there if you're interested.


Join us in our discord @ https://discord.gg/JQGWGwVwNU

** If you don't have access to gpt4, you can easily swap in 3.5 turbo, just update the model name in the server.

To follow along:

1. clone this repo
2. create a hobby plan at http://postgresml.org
3. update the env to include your openai key/org and postgres url string.
4. `npm i`
5. Create your table
5. `node embed.js`
6. `npm run dev`
7. chat away
