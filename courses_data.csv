HyCCPeb68,"Teaching, Learning and Leading: Effective Mathematics Instruction for All Students",EDGM697,"For all students to gain mathematical proficiency, schools, teacher leaders and teachers must address key issues at both the classroom and system level.   First, they must complete the shift from math teaching as computational and symbol manipulation to instruction that builds deep understanding of foundational mathematical concepts to a level that supports transfer of knowledge to higher levels of mathematics, to mathematics for citizenship and daily life, and to the mathematics demanded in today’s workplace. Second, they must change mathematics instruction that, for the most part, continues to be based on showing and telling, to instruction characterized by orchestrating learning through engaging tasks that require students to grapple and persevere (Leinwand, 2012). Although these features of highly effective mathematics instruction have been known for decades, if all students are to learn important mathematics the charge is to move from “localized pockets” of instructional excellence to “systemic excellence.” (Principles to Action, 2014).   Research suggests that the greatest influence on how a teacher teaches is what and how they were taught (Ball, D, 1988).  This suggests that all math teachers and the leaders that support individual and systemic change must first experience, learn and understand deeply the ways they must teach their students. Finally, “Teachers are among the most powerful influences in learning” (Hattie, 2012). Thus, the promise of highly effective mathematics instruction for all students is dependent upon deeply knowledgeable, capable and accomplished teachers and math leaders across systems.    
 

This course is the first in the program’s multi-course sequence focusing on mathematics teaching and learning. It is designed to introduce and examine concepts that form the foundation of highly effective instruction across grades K-8.

ByCDuXBTL,Statistics II for Teachers,EDGM705,"As discussed by Moore and Cobb (1997), “Statistics is a methodological discipline.  It exists not for itself, but rather to offer to other fields of study a coherent set of ideas and tools for dealing with data.  The need for such a discipline arises from the omnipresence of variability.”  The Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) Report, endorsed by the American Statistical Association, is the authoritative report that guides curricular decisions in K-12 and college education. The GAISE report describes this focus on the omnipresence of variability as the distinguishing feature of statistics education and the idea that sets statistics apart from mathematics.  As described in the report (2005), “a major objective of statistics education is to help students develop statistical thinking.  Statistical thinking, in large part, must deal with this omnipresence of variability; statistics problem solving and decision making depend on understanding, explaining, and quantifying the variability in the data.” (p. 6) 

This course provides an introduction to inferential statistics with an emphasis on statistical concepts and measures related to educational assessment. Participants apply their understanding of both descriptive and inferential statistics to interpret and critique educational research studies and analyze and interpret summative and formative assessment results.

SJgfhyUYS,"Philosophy of Love, Sex & Gender",PHL315,"Love, Sex, and Gender constitute a complex triad of concepts that play a central role in human life. Everyone, consciously or not, is constantly filtering their experiences and forming beliefs about the world on the basis of these phenomena. Behaviors, beliefs and choices are made on the basis of our understanding of them. Collectively, laws are made and religious ceremonies held that are meant to establish the importance of some (and, by extension, the triviality of others). But personally, our ideas about gender, our conceptions of sex, and our understanding of love are consistently a source of intense emotional responses and meaning in our lives, for better and for worse. Still, despite their centrality, it is common for us to adopt our notions of love, sex, and gender unthinkingly, and simply assume that our received accounts of them are natural, fixed and unproblematic.

All flight training from this point forward will be conducted from the Right Seat, as in almost every instance, the Commercial Pilot begins his or her career from that vantage point. Doing so prior to the CFI portion of the training program gives the student a great advantage in comfort and familiarity, allowing them to concentrate on the teaching, not just getting used to a new perspective when they begin training.  Finally, in the event the student goes directly to a line aviation position, they will find the transition to being a copilot uneventful, as they are already completely familiar comfortable with both seats and respective responsibilities of a cockpit crew environment.

CFI I will build on PLT 201, Principles of Instruction to indoctrinate the student in the discipline of in-flight instruction.  Focus will be on in-flight error detection and correction. While it is true that the transition from Private Pilot to CFI marks the point at which your dedication and training reaps financial benefits, most veteran pilots say the real benefit of being able to teach is how much you learn in doing it. Through the Commercial 1 began a process of familiarization with the Right Seat, this course will build on that familiarity to support your teaching while flying from that seat. This process, in fact, is merely a more directed form of the real-world CRM and SRM you have practiced from your first flights, and not only requires an ability to talk through all your procedures, but to learn to observe and direct others to do the same. For many, obtaining the Commercial and CFI Certificates is the culmination of a journey, for most, it truly is the start of another.
